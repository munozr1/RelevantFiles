# Relevant-Files README


## Features

# HTML -> TS
Due to the fact that this extension was inspired by constantly opening up html and typescript files side by side within an angular project, the first (and currently the only) feature is html -> ts

1. Have 2 editor groups open
2. navigate to an html file
3. cmd+shift+p to run the extension command

Finally, watch as the corresponding typescript file for the html opens to the side.

<!-- > Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->

## Requirements

Please make sure you have atleast 2 editors opened. 

## Extension Settings

## Known Issues

If there are not 2 editrs open, both files may be moved to a second editor group which could be anoyying. To avoid this, make sure there are atleast 2 edit groups open
